**In one sentence:** It runs the whole [`engine()`](../code/engine.md#engine) and checks that it stops on quit or close, returns on start-up failure, and always shuts SDL down.

**Why these tests matter:** A broken loop could hang forever or leave SDL running. These tests catch both.

## Setup and shared helpers

### `EngineTest` fixture

| Member / method | What it does | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SetUp()` | `shutdownPlatform()`; audio = `dummy`, render = `software` | Clean start; CI has no hardware |
| `TearDown()` | `shutdownPlatform()`; resets the three hints | Isolation |
| `PushQuit()` | Puts an `SDL_EVENT_QUIT` in SDL's queue | Makes the first frame stop the loop |

**Trick used:** to push an event, SDL's event system must be running, so tests call `SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVENTS)` **before** `engine()`.

## Individual tests

<a id="enginetest-whenstartupfailsenginereturnsandcleansup"></a>
### `EngineTest.WhenStartupFailsEngineReturnsAndCleansUp`

Video driver `nonexistent-driver`. `engine()` returns (doesn't hang), and `SDL_WasInit(0) == 0`.

<a id="enginetest-whenquiteventoccursenginestopsandcleansup"></a>
### `EngineTest.WhenQuitEventOccursEngineStopsAndCleansUp`

Queues a quit event, then runs `engine()`. The first [`processPlatformEvents`](../code/input.md#processplatformevents) returns false, the loop ends and SDL is shut down. **This also runs the full demo scene set-up**, including loading `assets/test.bmp` and `assets/anim_sheet.bmp`.

<a id="enginetest-whenwindowcreationfailsenginereturnsandcleansup"></a>
### `EngineTest.WhenWindowCreationFailsEngineReturnsAndCleansUp`

Video driver `dummy`, so window creation fails. It returns, and SDL is stopped.

<a id="enginetest-whenrenderercreationfailsenginereturnsandcleansup"></a>
### `EngineTest.WhenRendererCreationFailsEngineReturnsAndCleansUp`

Render driver `missing-test-renderer`. It returns, and SDL is stopped.

<a id="enginetest-whenwindowcloseisrequestedenginestopsandcleansup"></a>
### `EngineTest.WhenWindowCloseIsRequestedEngineStopsAndCleansUp`

Queues `SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_CLOSE_REQUESTED` instead of quit, to cover the second branch of the quit check.

<a id="enginetest-enginecanrunagainafterquitting"></a>
### `EngineTest.EngineCanRunAgainAfterQuitting`

Runs init-events, quit, `engine()` twice. Both runs end cleanly, which catches leftover global state.

## Running these tests

**Target:** `engine_tests`. **Command:** `ctest --test-dir build -R EngineTest --output-on-failure`.

**Dependencies:** `gtest_discover_tests` sets `WORKING_DIRECTORY` to the **project root**, so the relative paths `assets/test.bmp` and `assets/anim_sheet.bmp` used by [`engine()`](../code/engine.md#engine) resolve. Running the test executable from another folder would make the quit tests fail.

## Coverage gaps

- Nothing checks what is **drawn** or that the demo entities exist.
- No test for an asset that is missing during scene set-up (currently an uncaught exception).
